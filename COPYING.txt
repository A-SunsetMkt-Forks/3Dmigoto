3Dmigoto makes use of the Deviare-InProcess library from Nektra, which is

Please be aware that in some situations this may cause 3Dmigoto as a whole to

happen for example, when 3Dmigoto has been distributed in library form linked
against the Deviare-InProcess library. If you wish to use 3Dmigoto without
being bound by the terms of the GPLv3 you should purchase a commercial license
for Deviare-InProcess from Nektra, or completely remove the Deviare-InProcess
library prior to distribution.

Seems like using the standard profile is working OK.

3D doesn't always engage at game launch.  alt-tab out and back in, and it starts up.

The dog fur is a special setting, and looks like it has a deferred rendering problem.
It can be set to Off in the settings, which seems fine.

Water or grates are weird.  Double bars/mesh, that separate to distance.  Haloing of all overlap.

Crosshair is at screen depth, but if you enable Laser sight, it follows depths.
Nameplates are on same shader, as well as pause UI.

Screen Space AO set to HBA0+ makes screen white out and is bad. High works.

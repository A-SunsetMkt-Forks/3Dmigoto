Far Cry 4
=========

Installation
------------

1. Unpack zip to Far Cry 4\bin directory
2. Enable advanced keys in nVidia control panel
3. If game switches to windowed mode after launch, press alt+enter to switch back to full screen
4. If using a recent driver version >= 347.09, press ctrl+alt+F11 in game to disable compatibility mode

5. Set shadow quality to High or lower, I haven't fixed the higher quality shaders yet
6. Disable anti-aliasing. SMAA may create artefacts while moving, other options have totally broken shadows.
